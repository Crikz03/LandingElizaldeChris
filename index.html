                <p>Listening to music: Since I was very little music has caught my attention, it’s one of my favorite current hobbies. I really enjoy listening to my favorite artists, but I also don’t dislike listening to other types of music that aren’t really my taste, up to a certain point hahaha.  
                I also know how to play basic guitar since middle school, as well as the ukulele :DD.</p>

                <p>Watching videos: With this hobby I usually spend many hours, watching videos while I do homework, cook, etc. I often watch review videos whether they are about videogames or movies. I also enjoy IRL (In Real Life) videos where I get to know certain parts of the world and their cultures. </p>

                <p>Playing videogames: I’ve been playing videogames since I was 5 years old. However, nowadays it’s a hobby I don’t spend too much time on because of school, but when I get the chance, I try to take advantage of it and disconnect from the outside world. I have played countless games and completed them entirely, giving me hours of fun and even some lessons up to a point. I tend to like adventure, action, RPG, sci-fi, etc. games.

                    <p>Back to the Future Trilogy</p>
                    <p>This is one of my favorite movie trilogies, from the charisma of the actors to the main idea of time travel for the era in which it was released. The special effects simply blew my mind.</p>

                    <p>Stranger Things</p>
                    <p>This is one of my current favorite series. It came out in 2016 and I started watching it in 2017. I thought it was really good, offering a great variety of characters along with their development through the seasons. Season 4 is my favorite so far and I’m waiting for season 5 :D.</p>

                    <p>Spider Man 2 (2002)</p>
                    <p>This is my favorite Spider-Man movie. I watched it when I was only 5 years old and I loved it. It has very memorable moments like the fight between Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus, the redemption of the latter, and the revelation of Spider-Man’s identity to Harry Osborn.</p>

                    <p>Avengers: Infinity War</p>
                    <p>This movie has a very special place in my heart because I grew up watching MCU movies, from Iron Man 1 up to this movie, which concluded the Infinity Saga. After 10 years of build-up we had the union of all the heroes in a single film, resulting in one of the best superhero movies to date and a cinema event that was only repeated in its sequel (ENDGAME).</p>

                    <p>This movie is one of my favorites within the X-Men universe, as it’s the perfect farewell for such a beloved character. Hugh Jackman gave his last performance as Wolverine in Fox’s universe, gifting us emotional moments that made more than one shed a tear.</p>
